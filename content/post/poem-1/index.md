## Widow
```
Clad in white, she weeps for him, silently
Remembering those moments that alas can never come back.
Her veil turns wet, listening to the people,
Whoâ€™ve come to see him go, never to come back.

She sits calm after him, no feelings, no face.
She watches silently as the hose goes back to normal,
Making him the past, but not she.
Her veil dries up, she smiles at those moments of togetherness.
Only when the sun goes down & she lies to rest, is the veil wet again.
