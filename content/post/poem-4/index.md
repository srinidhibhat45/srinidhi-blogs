## Death
```
It is like a black hole, that sucks in everything,
The sufferings and pleasures of man, all at one go.
Even time cannot race against death;
For, once, it too has to die.

It is of no good running away from it.
The sooner you embrace the reality of death,
The lesser pain you feel.

Death has no discrimination,
All of mankind is equal to it,
Rich & poor, black & white, all alike.
```
