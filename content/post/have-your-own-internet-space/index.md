Ever wanted to have an internet presence of your own and have your own website? Me too! Having an Internet presence is very important in today’s age. No matter how small or non-flashy, having a website/webpage of your own is always a good thing to have. Obviously, I do not mean Instagram, Facebook, or other social media platforms where you can create and personalize an account, rather your own Internet space!

Now how do you do this? There are a lot of ways of doing this! The first and easiest is of course to use top-level Site Builders like:

- Google Sites (sites.google.com)
- Wix.com (www.wix.com)
- Squarespace (www.squarespace.com)

& many more...

For the Tech-Savvy peeps who have manageable knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and WebDev in General you can start with basic, but cool Static sites (No Databases). If you have problems with where to start, you can download free and amazing templates from sites like BootstrapMade (bootstrapmade.com) and HTML5UP (html5up.net) and edit them the way you like.

When you’re happy with your work, you can easily host these static sites on Cloud Servers like Netlify (www.netlify.com), GitHub Pages (pages.github.com), Vercel (www.vercel.com) & more. (Note: these sites do not give out free domain names and use their own eg: abc.netlify.app, pqr.github.io, and xyz.vercel.app. However, you can buy your domain names separately and use them with these hosting sites if you wish to.)

These hosting platforms are free, easy to use, and very scalable if you ever need it.

>PS: if you like more features like blogging, it is worthwhile to check out Static Site Generators like HUGO (gohugo.io) and Jekyll (jekyllrb.com) that use simple Markdown files as input to generate HTML pages that can serve as blog pages without the hassle of using or learning about DataBases. My own Blog site (srinidhi-blogs.netlify.app) is built on a HUGO theme!

You are now ready! If you are a student or an entry-level job seeker/intern, you can finish your work right here if you want, but in case you want to take it one step further and buy your own domain name, there are amazing sites that provide domain names at affordable and student-friendly prices as well. some of the good ones in the market are GoDaddy (godaddy.com), Name.com (name.com), BigRock (bigrock.in), Hostinger International (hostinger.in), Namecheap, Inc (namecheap.com), and many more!

The hosting sites above provide easy ways to use custom domains and set up your website easily and quickly.

Furthermore, if you wish to have even more features, there are many frameworks that can help you customize both your Front-end and Back-end functionality (Eg: Django and ReactJS)

You should be good to go! Would love to see your websites if you’ve made/plan to make them (email me @ srinidhibhat45@gmail.com)️.
