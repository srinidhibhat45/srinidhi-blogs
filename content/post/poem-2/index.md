## Longing 
```
My eyes hurt now, from the light of the stars of the night sky;
Which once used to be fascinating.
But that was so long back,
When I knew not was love and hate was.
Oh! So badly I miss those days,
When all I wanted to do was sleep all day, play, and then sleep again.
When friends werenâ€™t so difficult to make.
But now in this hollow world,
Where people judge you by how you are rather than what you are,
I still long for those days when I knew nothing,
When I was still fascinated by the bright stars of the night sky.
```
