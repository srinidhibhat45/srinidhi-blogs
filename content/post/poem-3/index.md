## Childhood 
```
Like the sand from his palms,
He saw it slip away,
Probably never to come back…

He tried to gather it,
Only to lose some more;
Like he did earlier, to the whirlpool of time.

He takes some to calm down, get over this,
Yet he tries, again;
But the bitter truth dawns upon him,
He realises like the sand it’s gone, forever,
His childhood.
```
