Dear Muslim Brethren,

We saw some of your brothers giving out roses to police officers, we feel you deserve roses too. This rose is to you from the nation…

We understand your feelings. We do not hate you or your religion or traditions. We respect them as much as we respect our own. We understand your need to protest as it is your right to do so. We understand that you feel you have been ‘discriminated’ or your brothers from the other countries have been discriminated on the basis of your religion, which definitely, is not the case. We have been trying to put it forth through various facts and logic that apparently no one seems to have been understanding.

We do not blame you for this. Nor do we generalise you for any unfortunate violence. We know the protest you had might have been peaceful, but some Anti-national elements ‘hijacked’ it as soon as they saw an opportunity to do so and tried taking advantage of the situation. Your only mistake was, Instead of going against these anti-national elements, you chose to go against the people who were against them. Which, any sane person will tell you is wrong. Now, you will not expect anyone, let alone the police, to sit quietly when stones are pelted or Anti-national slogans are raised or when buses are razed. They did what they had and what their duty compelled them to do.

You believed the people who tried to divide you, but agitated against those who tried to tell you the truth. You fell for a trap set for the division of the country by the politicians and anti-nationals who wanted to divide us.
Why? When you knew this bill was never meant for you or any other citizen, all religions alike, you still protested.

You breached the very thing you were fighting for – Secularism. You blamed the reaction but hid the action that lead to the reaction in the first place. People tried dividing us, which is bad, but what was worse was, you let them.

Again, we do not blame you or hate you But just like the way the hindu brothers stopped themselves from celebrating the Ayodhya verdict in their favour just because you might feel bad. We only wished that during the protest you won’t drag us or our religion in between….

At the end we still love you and want you back; but will never accept the people who caused this. We have held our arms wide open for you, we want to forget and forgive, again. Will you? the choice is all yours…

Yours Dearly, 

India
