## Senses
```
What if you were blind?
Would you still want good physique or a cute face?
Or would you only want love?

What if you were deaf?
Would you still want them to have a good voice?
Would you still like them to speak their love out to you?
Or would you just like to feel it in the warmth of their eyes?

What if you couldn’t speak?
Would you want to listen to them all day? 
Or would you let his eyes do the talking?

What if you couldn’t touch?
Would the tight hugs still matter?
Would the forehead kisses still manage to make you smile
and cry at the same time?

But,
What if you were totally fine?
But still couldn’t love?
